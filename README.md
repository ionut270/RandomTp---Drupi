# RandomTp (Drupi)

A simple Drupi random teleport plugin
Still in development*

## Introduction :

Have you ever gotten so bored on minecraft you could watch you'r diamonds being trown in lava ?
Well freet no more !
With random tp you could get to the schetchiest locations on the map.

- In a mountain
- In an ocean
- In a desert biome
- In you'r house
- Near the world border
- etc

*Everything is posible with randomTP

Command cooldown for default user is 24 hours and its not configurable.
A config which will let you change this along with the teleport radius will be added in the nearest future

## Permisions :

- rtp.use // acess to "/rtp" command
- rtp.super // acess to "/rtp" command without restrictions

## Requirements :

Drupi : https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/drupi.65706/

( [Drupi](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/drupi.65706/) is a plugin that allows anyone to customize their Minecraft server using simple scripts written in JavaScript. The possibilities for what you can do with Drupi are near limitless )

Once you have Drupi in you'r server's plugin folder, it's config folder will be created.
Paste the .js file inside Drupi/scripts/modules then run /drupi reload on the server.

## Enjoy !
